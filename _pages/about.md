I was born in the mid-80s and raised in the small town of [Glovertown] in the beautiful province of [Newfoundland and
Labrador], Canada. I am and have been for a long time, very passionate about software development. I have dreams about
debugging code while I sleep and once I managed to write a block of code in the middle of an English exam
absentmindedly. I truly live software development. I wrote my first, albeit small, program when I was 5 years old in
Basic on a VTech Pre-Computer. It was simple and only added two numbers together and I haven't stopped since then. I
started programming on a more professional level at the turn of the millennium.

I really enjoy learning new things and have been told by others, on a few occasions, that I pick up new technologies
extremely fast. I take great pride in every line of code I write and am always looking for ways to improve. I like to
write solid, maintainable code that has automated tests and is good documentation. I strongly believe that code is, at
least in part, art and have been known to describe a well-written code base as beautiful.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Memorial University of Newfoundland. During my undergrad, I spent
my time two years as the president of the [MUN Computer Science Society]. I was also the lead programmer for the
[Eastern Edge Robotics] team and responsible for the development of the control software for an underwater remotely
operated vehicle.

These days, in the little spare time I have, I run the [Computer Technology Society of Newfoundland and Labrador], a
community for those interested in computer-related technologies. I am constantly working on several personal projects
which can be found on my [GitHub Profile].
