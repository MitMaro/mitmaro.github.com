		I am Tim Oram. I was born sometime in the mid 80s and raised in the small town
		of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glovertown">Glovertown</a> in the beautiful
		province of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>.
		I am a computer programmer with an interest in software architecture and methodologies as well
		as that area where electronic hardware and software meet.
	</p>

	<p>I recently completed a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Memorial University
		of Newfoundland. While attending Memorial I spent my time with the
		<a href="http://http://muncompsci.ca/">MUN Computer Science Society</a> as the president
		for two years. I was also a member of the <a href="http://www.easternedgerobotics.com/">Eastern Edge Robotics</a>
		team as the lead programmer of a group of six programmers responsible for the development
		of the control software for an underwater remotely operated vehicle.
	</p>

	<p>In my spare time I am attempting to build a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/852120361467976/">community</a>
		for those interested in computer related technologies in the province; something that
		I believe is in dire need. I am currently working on several projects which can be found
		on my <a href="https://github.com/MitMaro">Github Profile</a>. When I am not programming I
		can often be found hiking on one of the many paths of the <a href="http://www.eastcoasttrail.ca/">East Coast Trail</a>.
